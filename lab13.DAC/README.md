## Description

- This lab has these major objectives: 
    1) to learn about `DAC` conversion; 
    2) to understand how digital data stored in a computer could be used to 
    represent sounds and music; 
    3) to study how the `DAC` and interrupts can be used together to create sounds.

## Preparation

- You will need a `LaunchPad`, four `switches`, four `10-kÎ© resistors` to interface 
the four `switches`, four to six `resistors` to build a `4-bit DAC`, the `headphone jack`, 
and a `headphone` or a `speaker`.

## How to Run

- Use the same configuration as in the previous lab.
