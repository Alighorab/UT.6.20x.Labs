## Purpose
- This lab has these major objectives: 
    1) an introduction to sampling analog signals using the ADC interface; 
    2) the development of an ADC device driver; 
    3) learning data conversion and calibration techniques; 
    4) the use of fixed-point numbers, which are integers used to represent non-integer values; 
    5) the development of an interrupt-driven real-time sampling device driver; 
    6) the development of a software system involving multiple files; and 
    7) learn how to debug one module at a time.


## Preparation

- You will need a `LaunchPad`, a `potentiometer`, and a `Nokia 5110 LCD`.

## How to Run

- Use the same configuration as in the previous lab.

## A Working Lab 14
